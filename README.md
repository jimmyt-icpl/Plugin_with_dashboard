# Wazuh Dashboard

Wazuh dashboard is a fork of the [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/) which incorporate changes to make it easier to use for Wazuh users. Our aim is to contribute back any work not tied specifically to Wazuh. 

Wazuh is a security detection, visibility, and compliance open-source project. Wazuh helps you to gain deeper security visibility into your infrastructure by monitoring hosts at an operating system and application level.

You can learn more about it here [wazuh.com](https://wazuh.com).
